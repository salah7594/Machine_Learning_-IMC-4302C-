    "In this practice session, you will work on \"Titanic\" database example (from the website [http://www.data-mania.com/](http://www.data-mania.com/)). This database contains different information about passengers of the sunk \"RMS Titanic\" ocean liner. The goal is to build classifier that predict if a passenger has survived or not the catastrophe based on the passenger age, sex, ticket fare ...\n",

Hence, in the first part you are invited to process the training data by removing unnecessary information and filling the missing data.\n",

    "In the second part, you should train a logistic classifier using [**sklearn**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library. then, you could assess its accuracy with some [**metrics**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.metrics) of sklearn. \n",
