    "# Lab 8: K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we illustrate how well accuracy measure evaluate the performance of a classifier on the case of skewed class where the number of sample on a given class is very big compared to size of other classes. Then, present more robust measurement like \"**precision**\", \"**recall**\" and \"**F1-score**\" to evaluate performance a classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part, we will implement a **K-nearest classifier**. It is a simple classifier but it may be efficient to resolve several classification problem. Then, we will assess our classifier with the new explored measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skewed Class\n",
    "In this part, we will work with [breast cancer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) dataset from sklearn library. It contains 30 quantitative features and one target with two labels (0:malignant / 1:benign). For this example, we will only use \"mean radius\" of tumor feature and we will also discard some sample to make dataset classes skewed. Then, we will calculate the accuracy of \"Naive_Classifier\" that predict always 0 or 1. Finally, we will present the new measurements given above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confusion matrix\n",
    "The confusion matrix is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance/error of a classification algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the number of samples in each predicted class while each column represents the number of samples in each actual class.\n",
    "![confusion_matrix](confusion_matrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- <font color=\"green\">**TN (True Negative)**</font>**:** Number of sample predicted 0 (**Negative**) and they are actually in negative class 0 (**True** prediction). Also known as \"Correct rejection\"\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">**FN (False Negative)**</font>**:** Number of sample predicted 0 (**Negative**) and they are actually in positive class 1 (**False** prediction). Also known as \"Miss\"\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">**FP (False Positive)**</font>**:** Number of sample predicted 1 (**Positive**) and they are actually in negative class 0 (**False** prediction). Also known as \"False alarm\"\n",
    "- <font color=\"green\">**TP (True Positive)**</font>**:** Number of sample predicted 1 (**Positive**) and they are actually in positive class 1 (**True** prediction). Also known as \"Hit\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Precision\n",
    "Precision or positive predictive value is the fraction of the true positive prediction over all positive prediction (true and false ones). It reflect how confident is the classifier when detecting a positive sample. It is given by the following formulas:\n",
    "$$precision=\\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$\n",
    "Therefore, higher precision imply less false alarm (FP).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recall\n",
    "Recall or sensitivity is the fraction of the true positive prediction over all actual positive samples. It reflect how confident is the classifier when rejecting a sample. It is given by the following formulas:\n",
    "$$recall=\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$\n",
    "Therefore, higher recall imply less positive sample non-detected (FN).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there is a trade-off between precision and recall. For example, with a logistic classifier if we try to increase the decision threshold (when the probability exceed this value we predict 1 as class)  to enhance precision the recall will decrease and vice versa as illustrated in the precision-recall curve below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![precision vs recall curve](P_vs_R.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### F1-score\n",
    "Because of the trade-off between precision and recall we try other measurement, the F1-score, to evaluate the performance of the classifier. Therefore, we could use the F1-score as single value criteria to compare and choose between two models. This measurement reflect how well precision and recall. For instance, if both precision and recall are high the F1-score is high and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1-score is given by the following formulas:\n",
    "$$F_1=2\\times \\frac{precision\\times recall}{precision+recall}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"blue\">**Question 1: **</font>\n",

    "- Complete \"fit\" function in \"Naive_Classifier\" class in order to assign to \"self.prediction\" variable the most existing class (0 or 1) in \"target\" array.\n",
    "- Call \"predict\" and \"score\" function from \"Naive_Classifier\" class to calculate \"y_pred\" and \"accuracy\" variable.\n"

The main idea is to determine the most similar (closest) samples from the dataset to the new sample to predict. Then, we predict a value close and similar to the value of nearest neighbors from the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In regression problem we determine ,for example, the 5 nearest sample (K=5) to our sample. Then, we predict as output the average  or weighted average of 5 nearest sample. There is several way to determine the weight. Some of them use constant weight. Other method use weight that inversely vary regarding the distance between our sample and neighbor and they use some kernel like \"linear\", \"Gaussian\"… to select these weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "While for Classification problem, we select the K-nearest neighbors. Then, we make a vote between neighbors to decide which label (class) to predict for our sample. In this case, K (number of neighbors) shouldn't be a multiple of number of class to avoid ambiguous vote. We could also use weighted vote regarding to the distance between neighbors and the sample to predict.\n",
